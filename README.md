# Zeek Resource List	

A small curated list of resources for the Zeek IDS. 



### Summary 

I created this document since Zeek isn't the most popular IDS, but it's one of the most powerful in my opinion. Since it isn't the most popular, I've found that documentation outside of the online manual is very sparse which makes it difficult for people who are unfamiliar and want to learn more. I've been studying it for just a few weeks now and the lack of community material creates a steep learning curve. 

NOTE: I do not own, create, or participate in any of these resources. I will continually update them as I research further and may create some type of course on Zeek, either written or VOD.
